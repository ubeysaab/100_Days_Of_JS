 This repo will be my learning playground, featuring daily challenges, mini-projects, and explorations of key JavaScript concepts from beginner to advanced.

## 📅 Challenge Outline

## 📌 Daily Logs

Each day's work will have a dedicated folder with a README summarizing:

I’ll organize daily logs to make it easy to follow my journey and document progress, challenges, and future goals.

## 🎯 Milestones

I’ll check in every 25 days to review my achievements, reflect on progress, and adjust my focus areas if needed.
